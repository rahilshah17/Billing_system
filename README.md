# Billing System

## Author

This is a project that uses the python to make a billing system.

Here, I have used python tkinter to develope a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI). After running the code one can easily take the 
input data from the customers. And add the available items in 
the stationary to the menu and and then generate a bill. This 
software then generates the bill and maintains record of the 
previous data.


## Demo

Over here I give the demo of how the billing system works. First 
of all one needs to clone this repository on your local computer.
And then run the code (main.py). 

The below screen pops up after running the code.

Now let us say that a customer wants 2 rakhis and 5 natraj
papers. Here, is how to use the system for this order.

First add the name and contact details of the customer by directly
clicking over the boxes and writing there.

Now update the quantity as shown on the right frame.

And then click on add item, the item will be added in the order 
frame.

And then press on add item

The item is now added on the order frame.

Now click on the bill button to generate the bill.

After clicking over it we will see a dialogue box as shown 
above asking if we want to print the bill. Enter yes and the bill will be generated as shown below.

The below image shows how the bill looks like

This is further stored in the records folder as a text file.
And everthying is cleared and made ready to take the next order.

Hope you liked the demo✌️✌️. Comment and tell about the
shortcomings and areas of improvement

### Taking this project ahead

- One can attach a printer and print the bills for every customer
- One can apply data analysis and understand about how about the 
patterns of goods bought for every customer, giving them personal
experience and better service.
- One can send the bill to the customer on the phone number given by him/ her.
